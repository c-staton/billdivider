## About the App

Bill Divider is an app that will split up your monthly bills with just a few clicks. A common headache is having to calculate how much each person needs to pay for a bill that has constantly changing variables. With Bill Divider you can add each cost one by one to create your bill. You then can enter the amount of people you want to split your bill amongst. Bill Divider will quickly calculate and display your bill for easy readability. Also Bill Divider saves all your bills to your account for a constantly kept record with viewing and editing capabilities for all past bills.

The design of this app was built with a mobile-first concept so that dividing your bill is as easy as possible even from your smartphone. With only a few clicks you can create an account, create a bill, and have a calculated bill ready to share with all your housemates in under 2 mins.

There is also a full backend to support the storing of all bills created for easy access to previously created bills. Both the PostgreSQL database and the Node/Express backend are both hosted using AWS (Amazon Web Services).
